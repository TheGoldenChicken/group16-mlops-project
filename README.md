# Group 16: Premise-Hypothesis classification

This is the exam project for course 02476, MLOps. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
The project is centered around a classic classification problem, with the main focuspoint being the classification of the FMNIST dataset ([A dataset of Zalando's article images - with each example being a 28x28 grayscale image with an associated label from 10 classes](https://huggingface.co/datasets/fashion_mnist))

The main third-party software, we have chosen to work with is **HuggingFace**, where we will obtain the dataset, along with **Lightning**, which implements the trainer automatically. Furthermore, there will also be attempts to do DVC, as the opportunity is present and relevant. 

The initial project was based on this [article](https://medium.com/@anuranjana25/multiclass-classification-for-natural-language-inference-bbc6b9df1b10), and still stands as a point of inspiration for the current project as well.
